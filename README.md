# Squares-web-app

This application allows users to edit images made up of squares and to save them to and load them from a server. Users can: Create and edit squares, recursively splitting or merging them. Change colors of individual squares (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, white). Name each design and save it to the server. Load previously saved designs and list all existing design names. Unit tests are included.

Instruction: Install the node modules, with npm install--no-audit, in both the client and server directories. Start both the client and server by running npm run start in both directories. Then navigate to where the client is running http://localhost:8080/.
